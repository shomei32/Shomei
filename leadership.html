            Shomei is focused on value-based sustainable deals where there is a
            differential in the intrinsic value of the asset and our purchase
            price.
          </h2>
          <p>
            Often, this intrinsic value comes from our unique power to
            strategically add value to investments that other groups cannot
            offer due to the decades of experience our partners have spent in
            capital markets and renewable energy development, as well as the
            strategic alliances we have formed within our target regions.
